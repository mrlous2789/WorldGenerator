## User interaction
The software is all contained inside a exe file. The user interacts with the software 
through the insterface which is made using the DearIMGui library. The interface is pretty
self explanatory and I beleive appropriately labled. On start up the program randomly
generates a new map. The user can generate new maps at the click of a button, Using the program in
Visual studio slows down the program quite a bit but map generation while using the exe file is instant.
The user is also able to edit part of map data such as Nations, Culture and Relgion. Map data can also
be saved and loaded.
## Code explanation
### Final product
So I think its best to show the final product to give context and then break it down.

This screen show a randomly generated map and the cells that make up the land are shown with borders
